			Ballroom Dance
		</h2>

		<p> I am an amateur ballroom dancer, and I have competed across the eastern US. I started dancing with the Tufts Ballroom Team in college. Here are some pictures of me dancing for Tufts with my wonderful former dance partner Joan.</p>

		<p>At Emory, I am helping to grow the Emory Ballroom Club and prepare its members to dance at competition. In Spring 2019, we had two couples compete for the first time at Georgia Tech, and in Spring 2020 we had more! Covid-19 presented a setback, but the club began actively dancing once again in Fall 2021 and brought several competitors to Georgia Tech's competition!</p>
