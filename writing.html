		<h2> Expository </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> To study for my algebraic geometry qual, I made this <a href="./files/definitions.pdf">list of definitions, results, and practice questions</a> (it's long but certainly not exhaustive).</li>
			<li> Here are some <a href="./files/derived_functors_notes.pdf">expository notes</a> I wrote while learning about abelian categories and derived functors.</li>
		</ul> 

		<h2> Math Circle Lessons </h2>

		<p>
			As an instructor for <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/mathcircle/">Emory Math Circle</a>, I have developed many lessons aimed at engaging middle and high school students in mathematics exploration. Below are some of my favorites. 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li> <a href="./mc_press_your_luck.html">The Mathematics of <em>Press Your Luck</em></a></li>
			<li> <a href="./mc_kakeya.html">The Kakeya problem</a></li>
		</ul>
