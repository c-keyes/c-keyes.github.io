		<h2>You should have a website (and it doesn't have to be hard)</h2>

			<p><em>(Originally published at <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2021/12/23/you-should-have-a-website-and-it-doesnt-have-to-be-hard/">AMS Graduate Student Blog</a> on December 23, 2021)</em></p>

			<!--<p>Back in October, <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2021/10/15/the-best-advice-i-never-follow/">Rohan's blog post</a> about the best advice he had received got me thinking about advice I've received (and some of which I've followed) over the years. In my first weeks as a PhD student I was encouraged to make a professional website, so I did. It was just
			</p>-->

			<p>
				Some months ago, a conversation among graduate students at Emory turned to the topic of updating websites. A few of us had yet to make one, so I joked that I could write a blog post on it, which was met with more enthusiasm than I expected. Later, I did some digging on the Emory directory and Google to find that only 6 out of the 37 PhD students currently at Emory have a webpage --- a number that I'd like to see grow! 
			</p>

			<p>
				To be fair to my 31 currently website-less colleagues, several are in their first year (or their first year in-person) and may not have needed one to this point. Others may be seeking government or industry jobs, where having a personal website may be less critical. I've also heard "but I don't have anything to put on it yet." To these I would reply that it's easier the earlier you start, it can't hurt to have no matter what jobs you apply for, and you don't need to put much on it for your website to pay off! 
			</p>

			<p>
				The thrust of my advice on websites to a beginning graduate student in math (and the advice that was given to me) is summarized in the title of the post: <em>you should have a website</em>. Below I'll expand a bit on why it matters, what you might put on it, and suggest a few ways to get started.
			</p>

		<h3>Why bother with a website?</h3>

			<p>
				The primary objective for your website is to make it possible for people - namely fellow researchers and potential employers - to find you and your work. The top answers on <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1316/personal-web-page-vs-academia-edu-vs-researchgate">this Stack Exchange post</a> put it really well; when you start writing papers and giving talks, people will look for you! Speaking personally (and reflecting what I've heard at countless career panels), I find information about fellow researchers through their websites. Most of the time, Googling "firstname lastname math" or "firstname lastname institution" will bring me straight to their personal webpage containing their research interests, links to papers, and contact information, so I want my website to do the same for others.
			</p>

			<p>
				To those students concerned that they don't have enough to share on a website, I'll quote computer scientist Bastian Rieck from his <a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/personal_website/">excellent blog post</a> on why academics should have personal websites: "<em>everyone</em> has something to share with the rest of the world." It's okay if that is just your contact information and office number for now! You'll be doing yourself a favor by having a website in place when you <em>do</em> have preprints or talk slides to share in the future. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Ultimately, your website provides a way for you to communicate who you are to the mathematical community. While this can be partially done through <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2021/10/08/formatting-your-cv-in-latex/">your CV</a> (which by the way should appear on your website!) or a LinkedIn page, a website offers much more control over how you present yourself, and the opportunity to make a memorable impression.
			</p>

		<h3>What should be on it?</h3>

			<p>
				The contents of an academic website, and how they appear, vary widely and are largely up to your personal preference. I recommend taking a look at the websites and asking the opinions of graduate students and faculty you know and trust. You'll likely get a lot of (possibly conflicting) answers, but you should be okay if you take the average of their advice. Below, I'll suggest possible contents of your website, starting with the bare minimum.
			</p>

			<h4>The bare minimum</h4>

			<p> Have <em>something</em> up there. It could just say your name and "I'm a grad student in math" and it would be a great start. Getting over the hurdle of putting <em>literally anything</em> on your webpage will make it so much easier to add more later!</p>

			<p> Having said that, here's what I would suggest starting with, which would all fit easily onto one page:
			<ul>
				<li>Your name (duh),</li>
				<li>Your institution and advisor (if you have one),</li>
				<li>Your contact information (probably email),</li>
				<li>A picture of you.</li>
			</ul>
			
				A note about pictures: I really do think having a fairly recent, professional-looking picture is important, as when people look you up and then meet you (or vice versa), they'll be able to put a face to the name. Some people may feel anxious about posting pictures of themselves publicly; if that describes you then feel free to skip the picture, but <em>don't let it stop you from putting up the rest!</em>
			</p>

			<h4>The standard content</h4>

			<p>
				Having looked at lots of academic websites, most contain the bare minimum above as well as following information, in one form or another. This is the key content that fellow researchers and employers will be interested in when they look you up. 

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Research</strong>: To start, this could be a sentence or two about your research interests. Once you have them, list any papers you've authored, including preprints, with links to the arxiv or the journal. You can optionally include links to your slides from when you've given talks, or even a video if the talk was recorded.</li>
					<li><strong>Teaching</strong>: List the courses you have taught or TA'd in the past. If you're currently teaching, you might include your office hours and links to the course syllabus for your students to find.</li>
					<li><strong>CV</strong>: Link to your CV (which you should have!).</li>
					<li><strong>Job market</strong>: If you're on the job market, say so! You might also include your research and teaching statements for prospective employers to find.</li>
				</ul>

				Of course, there's more to being a grad student than research and teaching. Do you teach math circle? Have you organized a seminar at your institution? Do you have a GitHub with code you'd like to share? Have you written any expository papers, or course notes you want to make public? Did you have an internship, and can you share anything about it? If you answer yes to any of these, find a place for them somewhere! Details like these paint a more complete picture of who you are as a mathematician.
			</p>

			<h4>Having fun with it</h4>

			<p>
				At this point you could certainly stop. But since you've made it this far, is there anything else you wish to share with the world? Maybe you're big on math Twitter or have some favorite math blogs which you could link to. Or perhaps you have hobbies or pictures to share that are entirely unrelated to math that you'd like to add - I say go for it! I myself have some <a href="http://www.math.emory.edu/~ckeyes3/fun.html">pictures of myself ballroom dancing</a> in college on my website. There's no need for them to be there, but I'm proud of them and who knows - they could one day serve as a conversation starter! This is all optional of course, but I have found that the most memorable websites tend to be the ones which give some indication as to who the <em>person</em> is, behind all the preprints and courses taught.
			</p>


		<h3>How to make it</h3>

			<p>
				Now it's time to justify the parenthetical in the title: <em>actually making</em> your website doesn't have to be hard. There are, however, a lot of options for doing so, which can be overwhelming if you've new to this sort of thing (I hadn't made a website before grad school). This isn't a step-by-step guide - you can easily find those elsewhere on the web - but instead some thoughts and resources which I hope help you to choose a platform and get started!
			</p>

		<h4>Website builders</h4>

		<p>
			The fastest way to get your website up and running is to use a service like Google sites, Squarespace, Wix, GitHub, or WordPress (they also feature blogs, like this one!), and countless others. I only have experience with Google sites and WordPress blogs, so I can't speak for the others, but I know they exist. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The primary advantage to taking this route is that it's really easy. With a Google site, you could probably have the whole thing set up in 10 minutes, with zero experience. All of the platforms mentioned above offer templates that you can start with to further streamline the process. If you don't have any experience working with HTML and don't want to learn, or just want to get this done with quickly, then one of these services is the way to go.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another plus of using one of these platforms is that they will host your site, often for free or for a small fee. As a graduate student, this can be really useful since you don't have to worry about your website when you graduate and move institutions. A downside is that free hosting restricts your URL to a subdomain such as "sites.google.com," or similar. If you have strong feelings about this, you could buy your own custom domain name for around $10 - $20 per year.
		</p>

		<h4>Do it yourself with HTML</h4>

		<p>
			Another option is to code your website yourself with HTML and have your institution host it. I went this route because I thought it might be fun and useful to learn some HTML, and doing things myself provided the most control over the appearance of my website. If you're the sort of person who learned LaTeX and vowed never to use a word processor again, this is probably what you want to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're just starting out, there are tons of free online <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">resources</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">tutorials</a> for learning the basics of HTML and CSS. You don't need to be an expert - I'm certainly not - but at minimum you'll want to be able to arrange text on your page, make lists, include images and links, and change the appearances of all these things. No special software is necessary: you can use any text editor to write your HTML code and any browser to open it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once you have your <tt>.html</tt> file, you'll probably need to put files onto a department server. If your department doesn't share instructions for this, ask a colleague who has their website set up already to walk you through the process (it shouldn't take more than a few minutes). I find it most convenient to keep all of my website-related files (<tt>.html</tt> files, style files, pictures, and pdfs) in one folder on my computer (backed up of course!) so I can edit them locally, then I just copy the entire file to our department server using the <tt>scp</tt> command when I want to update things. That way, whenever I have a new preprint or give a talk, I only need to add one line and enter one command to add it to my website.
		</p>

		<h4>Linking to your department directory</h4>

			Regardless of whether you choose a Google site or you write it yourself in HTML, make sure to get it linked on your institution or department's directory page! People actually do use these directories, so make sure there's a link to your webpage alongside your email and office number. Ask a colleague or your institution's IT staff for instructions.

		<h3>Concluding thoughts</h3>

		<p>
			It doesn't matter if you're in your final year, frantically applying for jobs, or just starting out as a graduate student --- you have something to share! If you don't think you have much yet, you will later on, so setting up your professional website earlier will save you time and effort down the road (when you're frantically applying to those jobs). 
		</p>

		<p>
			Wishing everyone a safe and pleasant winter break!
		</p>

		<!-- <h4>One page vs. multiple pages</h4>

		<p>
			After Google sites vs. HTML, the next most controversial website-related debate I've had with fellow graduate students is whether your webpage should be a single page, or spread over multiple pages with a navigation bar.

				<ul>
					<li>"low effort thing which can really only pay off - you know unless you have weird opinions that you're publicly posting, but you know don't do that. professional website only. LIke professional content only." - Daniel Keliher.</li>
					<li>"A lot of people have a lot of anxiety about putting pictures of themselves or their information online" -anonymous advisor to the author</li>
					<li>Best advice: ask people and take the average</li>
					<li>Have <em>something</em> up there</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Your name, a picture, your school, your year, your advisor, if you're on the job market, your CV (if you have one)</li>
						<li>Research: any papers you've written, with links to arxiv/journal (if you're fancy, include the abstracts. If you're really fancy, include a link to a video of you giving a talk.</li>
						<li>Teaching: what courses have/will you teach? When are your office hours? You may want to include links to homework assignments, the course Canvas page, etc.</li>
						<li>If you're on the job market, your research, teaching statements probably!</li>
						<li>Other relevant things. Do you teach math circle? Do you have a github with code you'd like to share? Have you written any expository papers you want to share? Did you have an internship, and can you share anything about it?</li>
						<li>Irrelevant things. What do you do for fun? Got any cool photos to share? Maybe you have some favorite math blogs, etc. to link on your website? This is all optional of course, but it helps to make your website your own.</li>
						<li>Goal is to have some way for people to find you professionally. Other industries use linkedin a lot, but speaking personally (and reflecting the advice/behavior I've observed) if I want to know more about someone, I google "Firstname Lastname math" and usually find what I'm looking for. When you give a talk, or put up a paper, people will want to know who you are, where you're at, and what else you're up to, so your website should provide those answers. </li>
					</ul>

					<li>Job market</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Teaching, research statements</li>
						<li>Most of your application materials should probably be on here in some form</li>
						<li>Recorded talks?</li>
					</ul>

					<li>Examples</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lea, Jackson, Daniel Keliher, my own, Santiago, alicia lamarche, DZB?</li>
						<li>Look at faculty/grad students in your department</li>
					</ul>

					<li>Getting started</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Google sites: really easy to use with zero background. Leave where it is if/when you move institutions. Downside is you get a "sites.google.com" ending, unless you pay for your own domain name ($10/year). You can still have your institution host/link to it.</li>
						<li>Other website builders include Wix, Squarespace, WordPress (they also feature blogs, like this one!), etc. I don't have experience with these, but they exist. </li>
						<li>Build your own! You don't need to know much to be able to make and format your own website. What you'll need is a text editor (like notepad on PC and textedit? on mac, or download something like sublime text), and a ".html" file. HTML is a markup language, so you write things in the text file and enclose them in brackets to say whether they're titles, headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. It won't be as fast as using Google sites, but using any online tutorial, you could probably have a page listing your basic info in about an hour. It's worht the investment in my opinion to spend a couple more hours learning how to format things nicely, possibly using css to customize the color and style of your website consistently. It's free, it'll make your website look better, and it's a useful skill (in fact this blog is based on html so that's how I write my posts).</li>
						<li>The sky is really the limit with making your own website. I'm content to mess around with layout, margins, and colors using html/css. If you look at the source code on my website, you'll see that it's just a nav bar and a block with some text and ordered/unordered lists. the most complicated things I have are some photos, a table, and the nav bar changing color when you hover the mouse over it (this is pretty easy, and requires only a small change in the style file). You could go learn javascript to make fancy, interactive things, or even without really learning you could probably cobble these sorts of things together with what you find online, but at this point we're officially past the point of what is most important, and you're doing it because you want to.</li>
					</ul>

					<li> At Emory, of the 37 PhD students, only 6 (!!!) have their websites posted in the department directory. Of those, 2 are google sites, 3 are self-styled in html, and 1 appears to currently be down. To be fair to us, many are in their first year (or their first year in-person), and haven't needed or wanted to up to this point, but I think that's all the more reason to put something up, so that when you do have things (papers, etc.) to put on it, it's right there! I know that not all advisors prioritize something like this (mine did) but presumably if you're reading this blog, you're at least open to other suggestions.
