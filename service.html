		<h2> Directed Reading Program </h2>

		<p>	I started a directed reading program (DRP) at Emory University and organized it from Spring 2021 until Spring 2023. The program pairs motivated undergraduates with graduate students to learn a topic together. <a href="https://www.math.emory.edu/~drp/">See this page</a> for more information. </p>

		<h2> Outreach </h2>	

		<ul>
			<li> I co-organized Emory's <a href="https://jrmf.org/">Julia Robinson Math Festival</a> on Saturday, August 27, 2022. We had over 150 people attend, including middle and high school students and their families!
				
			<li> I was an instructor with <a href="https://www.math.emory.edu/site/mathcircle/index.html">Emory Math Circle</a> for 8 semesters from Fall 2018 to Spring 2023. I planned and led lessons for middle and high school students at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels, serving over 200 students in the Atlanta community.

			<li> I was involved with with Emory Math Circle's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/emorymathcirclewome/home?fbclid=IwAR2pUfogTbXtVfHovkwQYLvqBwI6tHC40YE5v9kzJHUC8_yxF63IcDD3l-A">Week of Mathematical Exploration</a> in Summer 2019, a weeklong summer program which offers middle and high school students the opportunity to engage in mathematical research. 

			<li> From 2015 - 2017 I worked with <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/stomp/">Tufts STOMP</a>, a program that brings college students into elementary school classrooms to teach lessons on engineering and science.
